🚀 Seamless Document Upload via Mobile
📖 Project Story

When I was applying for my passport, I needed to upload several documents — Aadhaar, PAN, certificates, and more.
The problem? All my files were stored on my mobile, not my laptop.

That moment sparked an idea 💡
👉 “What if users could simply upload documents directly from their mobile using a QR code?”

That’s how Seamless Document Upload via Mobile was born.

🧠 About the Project

This system allows users to:

🔹 Scan a QR code from their desktop

🔹 Upload files instantly using their mobile camera or gallery

🔹 See uploaded files reflected on the desktop interface securely and seamlessly

⚙️ Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Other: QR Code Integration

I explored docs, tutorials, and multiple GitHub repositories to bring this idea to life.
Each bug fixed was a small victory that deepened my understanding of web development and backend integration 💪
